Multiplying the Margin: Achieving Bottom Line Growth via Smart Margin
Improvement

The business environment is as chaotic and uncertain as it's ever been.
Due to the uncertainty, most companies---even if they're growing
steadily---are always looking to improve their margins to increase
shareholder value . Margin improvement involves more than
cost-reduction, however. It involves taking a holistic approach that
looks at business functions and processes throughout the organization
and determines where the most achievable, sustainable opportunities lie,
and that uses a methodology that provides for rapid implementation and
demonstrates value quickly.

There are four areas where you can achieve the greatest margin growth:
cost management, liquid asset management, HR, and strategic growth
planning. At times, each of these areas will be ripe for strategic
initiatives that promote margin growth. However, they may also be
interdependent in that actions you take in one area may affect another
area.
