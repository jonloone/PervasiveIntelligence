Over the past half-decade, you've probably spent north of seven figures
on multiple business intelligence and analytics projects, looking to
drive better, deeper insights into your business, increase market share,
and grow your bottom line. Do you feel like you've gotten a decent
return on your investments so far? Are you getting the answers you need
from all those analytics capabilities you've deployed? Chances are, you
had to say no to one or both of those questions. If you did, you're in
data debt.

Data debt is the practice---if you can call it that---of implementing
short term, segmented, analytics/BI solutions to solve specific, or
departmental problems, without integrating them (purposefully or not)
into your overall business and IT strategy. It's that gap between the
cost of implementation and the actual return on investment (ROI). I call
it debt because it's money you've invested unwisely, and you'll have to
"pay back" at some point---whether it's through fixing the problems
you've created or with something more ominous: your career.

I know you have an analytics/BI strategy. But do you abide by it
all---or even most---of the time? You're not alone if you say no. Many
companies get caught up in the "me too" syndrome and give their
squeakiest wheels the most grease. Don't do that. All you're doing is
proliferating analytics/BI anarchy and acquiring more data debt. Instead
take a step back and look at what the problem might really be, how you
can fix and/or avoid incurring data debt, and what the long-term
consequences of your decisions could be.

Here's how you can begin to close the data debt gap and start earning
better return on your analytics/BI investments:

1.  **Figure out where your problems lie**. Assess the current state of
    your analytics/BI capabilities. Do you need all of them? Can systems
    be combined? Which systems are being used and which ones are---or
    worse---have been supplanted by unintegrated databases or
    spreadsheets? Which systems are providing you with the most reliable
    "version of the truth" about the questions your analysts are asking?

2.  **Get reacquainted with your analytics/BI strategy and fix it if
    necessary**. Assess your current analytics/BI strategy objectively
    with nothing held sacred; anything should be up for debate. Then,
    tweak it or reformulated it entirely to meet the needs of your
    business users. It's critical here to get the input of business
    users on the strategy. As the saying goes, analytics/BI should be
    business led and technology fed. Also, look toward the future.
    Technology changes rapidly. Your strategy should be flexible enough
    to accommodate those changes.

3.  **Be a good, but stern, cop**. Stay true to your analytics/BI
    strategy. Learn to say no---i.e., stop building customized solutions
    if they don't fit the strategy. This doesn't mean that you can't
    look for quick wins---those are critical to proving success and
    maintaining momentum. What it does mean is that if a project doesn't
    fit your strategy---or if it's the answer to an isolated
    problem---do some serious thinking about whether to implement it.
    Typically, you'll be able to tweak a system that's already in place
    to fit your needs. If not, do the math and make sure that you'll get
    the answers you want for the price you have to pay.

4.  **Rely on an old friend**: **data stewardship**. When no one owns
    data, it tends toward anarchy. As technology has changed and data
    has become more unstructured, data stewardship and governance have
    taken a back seat to a "just get it loaded and read" mentality. This
    creates a mess that lowers ROI. To fix the data mess, make sure
    there are data owners who are responsible for the quality of the
    data, and implement a data governance program to put data-quality
    standards in place. That way, no matter the technology, you can
    ensure that your data is clean, and your answers are clear.
