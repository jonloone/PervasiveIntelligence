Understandably so, the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is
about how it can augment human intelligence and free workers to work
smarter and concentrate on higher-level tasks. Indeed, of all
technologies developed in the past century, AI has the most power to
enhance human thought processes and transform the way we do business.
But to harness the full power of AI, we should use it for more than
simply making commerce easier and more profitable. I believe that it's a
moral imperative that we also use the incredible power of AI to advance
the public good.

AI = new---and better jobs

AI = better healthcare
----------------------

AI = A shot at solving the worst global problems
------------------------------------------------

> According to the most recent estimates by the World Bank[^2], in 2013,
> 10.7 percent of the world's population lived on less than \$1.90 US
> per day. That's an estimated 1.1 billion people living in extreme
> poverty. AI can help change that. For example, researchers are

> consumption of electricity or large-scale farming---take place.[^3]
>
> Researchers then couple this data with economic data to [paint a

> data in hand, they can use AI to analyze why the poverty exists and
> predict whether it will spread. And---most importantly---they can use

> policies and programs to alleviate and prevent poverty in the future.

The uses of AI that I've discussed here are only a few of the many,
almost miraculous, uses of AI to advance society and make the world a
better place. As technology advances, there is virtually no limit to the
uses of AI. As we use AI to create amazing new ways to make money, we
should also make sure that we're using it to make our lives better as
well.
